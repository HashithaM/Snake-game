# Snake-game
This code is the popular snake game python code
The code sets up a Snake game using the Turtle module in Python.
It imports necessary modules and classes: Screen, Snake, Food, and ScoreBoard.
The game window is initialized with a black background and a title "My_Snake_Game".
The Snake, Food, and Scoreboard objects are created.
Keyboard bindings are set up to control the snake's movement using arrow keys.
The main game loop continuously updates the screen, moves the snake, and checks for collisions.
The snake's movement speed is regulated by a 0.5-second delay between frames using time.sleep(0.5).
Collision detection logic includes checking for collisions with food, walls, and the snake's own tail.
If a collision occurs with food, the food is refreshed, the snake grows, and the score increases.
If the snake collides with the walls or its own tail, the game resets, and the score is reset to zero.
The game window remains open until the user clicks to exit.
